### A private set intersection protocol based on multi-party quantum computation for greatest common divisor
Author: [Muhammad Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io) <br>The preprint version is available in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17196).

Private set intersection (PSI) is a cryptographic primitive that allows two or more parties to learn the intersection of their input sets and nothing else. In this paper, we present a private set intersection protocol based on a new secure multi-party quantum protocol for greatest common divisor (GCD). The protocol is mainly inspired by the recent quantum private set union protocol based on least common multiple by Li, Yang, and Liu. Performance analysis guarantees the correctness and it also shows that the proposed protocols are completely secure in semi-honest model. Moreover, the complexity is proven to be efficient in the size of the input sets.

### Hidden stabilizers and the Isogeny to Endomorphism Ring Problem
Author: [Muhammad Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io), [Gábor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/), [Péter Kutas](https://sites.google.com/view/peterkutas89/main-page?authuser=0), & [Antonin Leroux](https://tonioecto.github.io/antoninleroux/). <br> The paper is submitted to [Crypto 2023](https://crypto.iacr.org/2023/).

This paper studies the problem of computing the endomorphism ring of the codomain of a secret isogeny between supersingular curves in characteristic $p$ given a representation for this isogeny, i.e. a way to evaluate this isogeny on any torsion point. This problem, that we call the Isogeny to Endomorphism Ring Problem (IsERP), plays a central role in isogeny-based cryptography and is at the heart of the recent attacks that broke the SIDH key exchange. However, no efficient algorithm is known to solve the IsERP for a generic degree, and the hardest case seems to be when the degree is prime. The key exchange pSIDH recently proposed by Leroux bases its security on the prime-degree version of the IsERP. We propose a quantum polynomial-time attack with subexponential classical precomputation (computation that only depends on the starting curve and the degree but not on the secret isogeny) on IsERP for any isogeny degree.  A key implication of this is that one should not reuse the starting curve and the degree in pSIDH.  We use two main tools: the group action of $(\mathrm{End}(E)/N\mathrm{End}(E))^*$ on the set of $N$-isogenies and a related non-abelian hidden subgroup problem that can be solved in quantum polynomial time. 
  
The task of the precomputation is a pure quaternion problem. Namely, one is given a maximal order $O$, $\tau\in O$ and integer $N$ and one has to find $\sigma\in O$ such that the norm of $\tau+N\sigma$ is powersmooth. This problem might be of independent interest as it closely related to subroutines in the celebrated KLPT algorithm and SQISign. Currently we are aware of a classical subexponetial time method for this task. We show that if one lifts $O(\log p)$ special elements, then lifting an arbitrary $\sigma$ can be accomplished in quantum polynomial time.

### An exact quantum order finding algorithm and its applications
Author: [Muhammad Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io). <br>The preprint version is available in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04240).

The main key of Shor's algorithm for factoring integers $m$ is a quantum algorithm for finding order of elements in the unit group $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$ of the group of integer modulo $m$. However, the quantum algorithm is polynomial-time in the expected sense, which means it may fail with a small probability and in the unlucky case may take a very long time to succeed, even may never terminate. By the observation that knowing a multiple of the group order $\varphi(m)$ would factor $m$ in randomized classical polynomial time, finding orders of group elements with a known multiple of the order is not necessarily as hard as factoring, so a multiple of the order may be a good help for derandomizition of the quantum algorithm for order finding problem. Some computational problems where such a help available are primality testing problem and the problem of finding primitive elements in arbitrary finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. However, such a help is not available for factoring problem as $\varphi(m)$ is unknown in general.

### An exact quantum hidden subgroup algorithm and applications to solvable groups
Authors: [Muhammd Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io) & [Gábor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). <br>The paper is available in [Quantum Information and Computation](https://doi.org/10.26421/QIC22.9-10-4) or the preprint version in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04047).

The natural characteristic of quantum algorithms is probabilistic, since it takes advantage from the quantum principles (superposition, interference, entanglement, etc.). The common technique to boost up the success probability of quantum algorithms is amplitude amplification which is a generalization of Grover's algorithm. Therefore, it is a natural question whether it is possible to boost up the probability to certainty while maintaining the efficiency. In the hidden subgroup problem, the existing of exact quantum algorithms is still limited:
* The exact quantum hidden subgroup algorithm in $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$ by Brassard and Hoyer in [BH97](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9704027);
* The exact quantum algorithm for discrete logarithm problem in abelian groups of known order by Mosca and Zalka in [MZ03](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301093).

In this paper, we construct an exact quantum algorithm for the hidden subgroup problem in the infinite family of groups $\mathbb{Z}_{m^k}^n$. Even for $m=3$ and $k=1$, our algorithm appears to be new. Moreover, we provide the applications of the algorithm in some computational problems in solvable groups such as membership testing, the construction of normal series, etc.

### Zero sum subsets and hidden subgroup problem
Authors: [Muhammd Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io) & [Gábor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/).
  
In this project, we succeed to construct the first exact quantum hidden subgroup algorithm for a class of non-abelian groups, namely nilpotent groups of constant nilpotency class and of smooth order. The main key of the algorithm is by series of reductions to groups of smaller nilpotency class (through its central series) using new zero sum subset algorithm in the group $\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ for prime number $p$.

### Stripped, multidimensional version of the Childs–van Dam approach to the hidden multiple shift problem
Author: [Muhammd Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io).

The hidden multiple shift problem (HMS) can be seen as an interpolation between the abelian and dihedral hidden subgroup problems. HMS is defined as follows, We are given a subset $H\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_q$ of cardinality $r$. (Here $q$ is an integer greater than $1$, not necessarily a prime.) A function $f_s:\mathbb{Z}_q^n\times H\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^l$ is given by an oracle, where $f_s(x,h)=f(x-hs)$ for some $s\in \mathbb{Z}_q^n$, and an injective function $f:\mathbb{Z}_q^n \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^l$. The goal is to find $s$ modulo $\gcd\\{q,h-h':h,h'\in H\\}$. Two extream cases are when $H=\mathbb{Z}_q$ then it is an abelian hidden subgroup problem in $\mathbb{Z}_q^{n+1}$ which can be efficiently solved by quantum computers, while when $\|H\|=2$ then it is dihedral hidden subgroup problem in which the best known quantum algorithm ([Kuperberg's algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302112)) has subexponential complexity. The study of HMS recently appears as a promising approach to both lattice-based and  isogeny-based cryptography, see [BKSW18](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-76581-5_24) and [IIKL23]() respectively.

In this project, we would like to construct a stripped (free of "pretty good measurement") version of the [Childs-van Dam](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0507190) method to the hidden multiple shift problem for multidimensional case, particularly for constant dimension/rank.

### Hidden subgroup problem in cryptography: a survey
Author: Muhammad Imran

In this survey, we conduct a systematic literature review on the most recent and important development in classical and quantum algorithms for some instances of finite hidden subgroup problem which have strong connections with cryptography: lattice-based cryptography, isogeny-based cryptography, and some secure cryptographic protocols. The main purpose of this survey is to give cryptographic motivations for further investigations on finite hidden subgroup problem.
